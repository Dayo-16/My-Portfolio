# My-Portfolio
# README
This portfolio website was created as a personal project to showcase my professional background, educational achievements, technical skills, and key academic works. Designed with simplicity and elegance in mind, the website is structured using only HTML and CSS. It includes a landing page that introduces visitors to the site, followed by a main content page that provides detailed information about my qualifications and projects.

The landing page is styled to make a strong visual impression using a calligraphic font and centered text layout. It warmly welcomes visitors to explore the rest of the site. The main page contains sections such as an About Me section, Educational Background, Projects, Interests, and a downloadable CV. It also includes a contact section where visitors can reach out for collaboration or inquiries.
Each section is carefully styled with a consistent color scheme, primarily using shades of brown for backgrounds and headings, black for paragraph text, and white for highlighted elements such as the main heading. The design choices are meant to reflect professionalism while maintaining a clean and user-friendly interface.

This project is hosted on GitHub and can be accessed through the GitHub Pages link. It was developed as part of a broader goal to present myself digitally in a structured and presentable way, especially within the nursing and healthcare field. The documents included, such as my CV and academic research papers, provide deeper insight into my background and areas of interest.
This website is entirely front-end based and does not use any backend technologies or frameworks. It is ideal for static hosting environments and is optimized for accessibility and ease of navigation.
For any questions, contributions, or collaborations, you are welcome to connect with me through my GitHub profile.
Thank you for visiting my portfolio.
