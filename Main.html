    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Oladeji Victoria Opemipo, a passionate learner and aspiring web developer and aspiring software engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria who enjoys building creative and functional websites.</p>
<p>I am currently focused on learning front-end development and enjoy creating websites using HTML and CSS. My passion for technology is driven by curiosity and a desire to build tools that solve real-world problems.</p>
  <p>With a background in healthcare and a strong interest in digital innovation, I aim to use my tech skills to improve the healthcare system — by creating accessible, user-friendly platforms that can streamline patient care, medical recordkeeping, and health education.</p>
  <p>My goal is to become a full-stack developer and contribute to meaningful projects that make healthcare more efficient, inclusive, and technology-driven.</p>
  <p>Outside of tech, I love watching anime, reading, and volunteering in my local tech community.</p>
